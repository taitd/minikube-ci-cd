# Minikube CI/CD

The minikube-ci-cd project showcases Kubernetes features like compiling java, creating .war, sonarqube, artifactory, spinning up multiple pods and running a load test at scale. 
It also features Sonarqube, Artifactory and Jenkins running on its own a container and a JenkinsFile script to demonstrate how Kubernetes can be integrated into a full CI/CD pipeline. 

To get it up and running, simply follow the directions below. 

#### 1

`minikube start --memory 8000 --cpus 2 --kubernetes-version v1.8.0`

#### 2

Wait 20 seconds, and then view the Minikube Dashboard, a web UI for managing deployments.

`sleep 20; minikube service kubernetes-dashboard --namespace kube-system`

#### 3

Deploy the public nginx image from DockerHub into a pod. Nginx is an open source web server that will automatically download from Docker Hub if it’s not available locally.

`kubectl run nginx --image nginx --port 80`

#### 4

Create a service for deployment. This will expose the nginx pod so you can access it with a web browser.

`kubectl expose deployment nginx --type NodePort --port 80`

#### 5

Launch a web browser to test the service. The nginx welcome page displays, which means the service is up and running.

`minikube service nginx`

#### 6

Set up the cluster registry by applying a .yml manifest file.

`kubectl apply -f manifests/registry.yml`

#### 7

Wait for the registry to finish deploying. Note that this may take several minutes.

`kubectl rollout status deployments/registry`

#### 8

View the registry user interface in a web browser.

`minikube service registry-ui`

#### 9

Now let’s build an image, giving it a special name that points to our local cluster registry.

 docker build -t 127.0.0.1:30400/spring-petclinic:latest -f applications/spring-petclinic/Dockerfile applications/spring-petclinic

#### 10

We’ve built the image, but before we can push it to the registry, we need to set up a temporary proxy. By default the Docker client can only push to HTTP (not HTTPS) via localhost. To work around this, we’ll set up a container that listens on 127.0.0.1:30400 and forwards to our cluster.

 docker stop socat-registry; docker rm socat-registry; docker run -d -e "REGIP=`minikube ip`" --name socat-registry -p 30400:5000 chadmoon/socat:latest bash -c "socat TCP4-LISTEN:5000,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:`minikube ip`:30400"

With our proxy container up and running, we can now push our image to the local repository.

 docker push 127.0.0.1:30400/spring-petclinic

#### 11

The proxy’s work is done, so you can go ahead and stop it.

`docker stop socat-registry;`

#### 12

Install Jenkins, which we’ll use to create our automated CI/CD pipeline. It will take the pod a minute or two to roll out.

`kubectl apply -f manifests/jenkins.yml; kubectl rollout status deployment/jenkins`

#### 13

Open the Jenkins UI in a web browser.

`minikube service jenkins`

#### 14

Display the Jenkins admin password with the following command, and right-click to copy it. IMPORTANT: BE CAREFUL NOT TO PRESS CTRL-C TO COPY THE PASSWORD AS THIS WILL STOP THE SCRIPT.

 kubectl exec -it `kubectl get pods --selector=app=jenkins -output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}` cat /root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

#### 15

Switch back to the Jenkins UI. Paste the Jenkins admin password in the box and click Continue. Click Install suggested plugins and wait for the process to complete.

`echo ''`

#### 16

Create an admin user and credentials, and click Save and Finish. (Make sure to remember these credentials as you will need them for repeated logins.) Click Start using Jenkins.

`echo ''`

#### 17

We now want to create a new pipeline for use with our Hello-Kenzan app. On the left, click New Item. Enter the item name as "Hello-Kenzan Pipeline", select Pipeline, and click OK.

`echo ''`

#### 18

Under the Pipeline section at the bottom, change the Definition to be "Pipeline script from SCM".

`echo ''`

#### 19

Change the SCM to Git.

`echo ''`

#### 20

Change the Repository URL to be the URL of your forked Git repository, such as https://github.com/[GIT USERNAME]/minikube-ci-cd. Click Save. On the left, click Build Now to run the new pipeline.

`echo ''`

#### 21

Set up a proxy so we can push the spring-petclinic Docker image we just built to our cluster's registry.

`docker stop socat-registry; docker rm socat-registry; docker run -d -e "REGIP=`minikube ip`" --name socat-registry -p 30400:5000 chadmoon/socat:latest bash -c "socat TCP4-LISTEN:5000,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:`minikube ip`:30400"`

#### 22

Push the spring-petclinic image to the registry.

`docker push 127.0.0.1:30400/spring-petclinic:`git rev-parse --short HEAD``

#### 23

The proxy’s work is done, so go ahead and stop it.

`docker stop socat-registry`

#### 24

Open the registry UI and verify that the spring-petclinic image is in our local registry.

`minikube service registry-ui`

#### 25

Create the spring-petclinic deployment and service.

`sed 's#127.0.0.1:30400/spring-petclinic:latest#127.0.0.1:30400/spring-petclinic:'`git rev-parse --short HEAD`'#' applications/spring-petclinic/k8s/deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -`

#### 26

Wait for the spring-petclinic deployment to finish.

`kubectl rollout status deployment/spring-petclinic`

#### 27

View pods to see the spring-petclinic pod running.

`kubectl get pods`

#### 28

View services to see the spring-petclinic service.

`kubectl get services`

#### 29

View ingress rules to see the spring-petclinic ingress rule.

`kubectl get ingress`

#### 30

View deployments to see the spring-petclinic deployment.

`kubectl get deployments`

#### 31

Check to see if the frontend has been deployed.

`kubectl rollout status deployment/spring-petclinic`

#### 32

Check out all the pods that are running.

`kubectl get pods`

#### 33

Enter the following command to open the Jenkins UI in a web browser. Log in to Jenkins using the username and password you previously set up.

`minikube service jenkins`

#### 34

We’ll want to create a new pipeline for the spring-petclinic service that we previously deployed. On the left in Jenkins, click New Item.

`echo ''`

#### 35

Enter the item name as "spring-petclinic", click Pipeline, and click OK.

`echo ''`

#### 36

Under the Build Triggers section, select Poll SCM. For the Schedule, enter the the string H/5 * * * * which will poll the Git repo every 5 minutes for changes.

`echo ''`

#### 37

In the Pipeline section, change the Definition to "Pipeline script from SCM". Set the SCM property to GIT. Set the Repository URL to your forked repo (created earlier), such as https://github.com/[GIT USERNAME]/minikube-ci-cd.git. Set the Script Path to applications/puzzle/Jenkinsfile


Commit and push the change to your forked Git repo.

`echo ''`

#### Step11

In Jenkins, open up the spring-petstore pipeline and wait until it triggers a build. It should trigger every 5 minutes.
